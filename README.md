6.1 Costmaps Explained

Costmap Layers:

    Static Layer    ──►  Pre-known obstacles from map
    Obstacle Layer  ──►  Sensor data (LiDAR, depth camera)
    Inflation Layer ──►  Expands obstacles with cost decay

Cost Values:

    0      ← Free space (No obstacle)
    1-127  ← Inflated area (Cost decreases with distance)
    128    ← Unknown space
    129-252 ← Lethal obstacle (Planner avoids)
    253    ← Inscribed (Robot footprint collides)
    254    ← Lethal (Direct collision)
    255    ← No information
